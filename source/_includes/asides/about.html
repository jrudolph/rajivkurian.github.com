  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I work as a software engineer primarily writing backend services.</p>
  <p>I have committed grave sins such as using C++ and Java in the past. To atone for my sins I have started using more modern languages like Scala. At work I primarily work on a Scala and Akka stack. In my spare time I like playing with languages such as Go and Rust. My topics of interest include concurrency and distributed systems.</p>
